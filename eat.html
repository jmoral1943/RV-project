                    <p> Iceland was founded by Iceland by Ingólfur Arnarson, and most of the settlers came from Norway. And since its difficult to grow alot 
                        of food locally they mainly rely on live stock such as lamb and seafood. 
                    </p>   
                    <p>But Iceland still have so many lovely restuarants such as the <a href="http://www.dillrestaurant.is/en/home/" >Dill</a>,

                        most delicous and different bread called 'Flatkaka' that is made of rye that is a thin round flatbred because it is difficult to grow grain in Iceland, 
                        therefore being Icelandic people they were resilient and found another way to make bread. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the most famous food that Iceland makes best is there Skyr yogurt, the lamb, fermented shark, puffin, fish stew, and the coffee.
